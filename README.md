The Gramps Project ( https://gramps-project.org ) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gramps-project/gramps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gramps-project/gramps)[![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/gramps-project/gramps/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/gramps-project/gramps?branch=master)
===================
We strive to produce a genealogy program that is both intuitive for hobbyists and feature-complete for professional genealogists.

Please read the **COPYING** file first.

Please read the **INSTALL** file if you intend to build from source.

Requirements
============
The following packages **MUST** be installed in order for Gramps to work:

* **Python** 3.2 or greater - The programming language used by Gramps. https://www.python.org/
* **GTK** 3.10 or greater - A cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. http://www.gtk.org/
* **pygobject** 3.12 or greater - Python Bindings for GLib/GObject/GIO/GTK+ https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject

The following three packages with GObject Introspection bindings (the gi packages)

* **cairo** 1.13.1 or greater - a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. http://cairographics.org/
* **Pycairo** 1.13.3 or greater - GObject Introspection bindings for cairo. https://github.com/pygobject/pycairo
* **pango** - a library for laying out and rendering of text, with an emphasis on internationalization. http://www.pango.org/
* **pangocairo** - Allows you to use Pango with Cairo http://www.pango.org/

* **librsvg2** - (SVG icon view) a library to render SVG files using cairo. http://live.gnome.org/LibRsvg
* **xdg-utils** - Desktop integration utilities from freedesktop.org
* **bsddb3** - Python bindings for Oracle Berkeley DB https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bsddb3/
* **sqlite3** - Python bindings for SQLite Database library

The following package is needed for full translation of the interface
to your language:

*   **language-pack-gnome-xx**

 Translation of GTK elements to your language, with
 xx your language code; e.g. for Dutch you need
 language-pack-gnome-nl. The translation of the
 Gramps strings is included with the gramps source.


The following packages are **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** to be installed:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*  **osmgpsmap**

 Used to show maps in the geography view.
 It may be osmgpsmap, osm-gps-map, or python-osmgpsmap,
 but the Python bindings for this must also be present, so gir1.2-osmgpsmap-1.0.
 Without this the GeoView will not be active, see
 https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gramps_5.0_Wiki_Manual_-_Categories#Geography_Category

* **Graphviz**

  Enable creation of graphs using Graphviz engine.
  Without this, three reports cannot be run.
  Obtain it from: http://www.graphviz.org or try graphviz and python3-pygraphviz from your packages.

* **PyICU**

 Improves localised sorting in Gramps. In particular, this
 applies to sorting in the various views and in the
 Narrative Web output. It is particularly helpful for
 non-Latin characters, for non-English locales and on MS
 Windows and Mac OS X platforms. If it is not available,
 sorting is done through built-in libraries. PyICU is
 fairly widely available through the package managers of
 distributions. See http://pyicu.osafoundation.org/
 (These are Python bindings for the ICU package. 
 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU/)

* **Ghostscript**

  Used by Graphviz reports to help create PDF's

The following packages are optional:
------------------------------------
* **gtkspell** 

 Enable spell checking in the notes. Gtkspell depends on
 enchant. A version of gtkspell with gobject introspection
 is needed, so minimally version 3.0.0

* **rcs**

 The GNU Revision Control System (RCS) can be used to manage
 multiple revisions of your family trees. See info at
 https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gramps_5.0_Wiki_Manual_-_Manage_Family_Trees#Archiving_a_Family_Tree
 Only rcs is needed, NO python bindings are required

* **PIL**

 Python Image Library (PILLOW) is needed to crop
 images and also to convert non-JPG images to
 JPG so as to include them in LaTeX output.
 (For Python3 a different source may be needed,
 python-imaging or python-pillow or python3-pillow)

* **GExiv2**

 Enables Gramps to manage Exif metadata embedded in your
 media. Gramps needs version 0.5 or greater.
 See https://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=GEPS_029:_GTK3-GObject_introspection_Conversion#GExiv2_for_Image_metadata

* **ttf-freefont**

 More font support in the reports

* **geocodeglib**

 A library use to associate a geographical position (latitude, longitude)
 to a place name. This is used if you already have osmgpsmap installed.
 If installed, when you add or link a place from the map, you have a red line
 at the end of the table for selection.
 Debian, Ubuntu, ... : gir1.2-geocodeglib-1.0
 Fedora, Redhat, ... : geocode-glib
 openSUSE            : geocode-glib
 ArchLinux           : geocode-glib
 ...

Optional packages required by Third-party Addons
------------------------------------------------

**Third-party Addons are written by users and developers and unless stated are not officially part of Gramps.**
For more information about Addons see:  https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Third-party_Plugins

Prerequistes required for the following Addons to work:

* **Family Sheet** - Requires: PIL (Python Imaging Library) or PILLOW.
( https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Family_Sheet )

* **Graph View** - Requires: PyGoocanvas and Goocanvas (python-pygoocanvas, gir1.2-goocanvas-2.0).
( https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Graph_View )

* **Network Chart** - Requires: networkx and pygraphviz
( https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=NetworkChart )
