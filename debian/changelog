 -- Alex Roitman <shura@alex.neuro.umn.edu>  Wed, 26 Jun 2002 19:56:06 -0500

gramps (0.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Added new entry to the upstream NEWS file - it was missing.
  * Added '#! usr/bin/python -O' line to src/AddMedia.py to make lintian happy.
    Also removed this line from src/DbPrompter.py for the same reason.
  * Edited debian/rules to call '$(MAKE) clean' instead of
    '$(MAKE) distclean' which did not exist.
  * Edited src/Makefile.in - 'clean' target should also remove *.so files.
  * Pre-built static HTMLs since the on-the-fly generation from SGML is buggy.
    This required editing debian/rules to call '$(MAKE) install-html',
    and editing doc/*/C/Makefile.in to not remove static HTMLs.

 -- Alex Roitman <shura@alex.neuro.umn.edu>  Mon, 24 Jun 2002 12:18:57 -0500

gramps (0.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Closes: #127401

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Apr 2002 07:30:17 -0500

gramps (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Dec 2001 08:11:44 -0500

gramps (0.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Closes: #119950
    Closes: #116893

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Nov 2001 04:29:47 -0500

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Nov 2001 15:31:51 -0500

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Wed,  3 Oct 2001 21:00:28 -0400

gramps (0.5.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * A change in the way the makefile was used caused the executables to not
    be installed correctly, this version should fix that.
    Closes: #113147
  * I have included two sets of DOCS with this package.
    - The Gramps Manual
    - Extending Gramps
    I'm not registering these with doc-base, read the README.Debian if
    you'd like to know why.

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Sep 2001 12:02:24 -0400

gramps (0.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Sep 2001 21:23:06 -0400

gramps (0.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Paul Slootman was nice enough to point out my ignorance in the rules file
    where I expected a script to be executable and indeed it wasn't. Thanks,
    Paul for the patch.
    Closes: #110570

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Aug 2001 15:01:38 -0400

gramps (0.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lintian was yelling hard at me. It seems that every_single file is set with
    an executable bit. I wrote a shell script to remove it from the files that
    do not need it and am informing the upstream author.
  * Fixed the menu entry where I left in a | where it was not needed.
  * A few more lintian clean-ups as well such as me using an "ancient"
    standards version and a typo in the copyright.

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Aug 2001 23:42:05 -0400

gramps (0.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Aug 2001 10:37:14 -0400

gramps (0.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Added a bit more docs, but nothing major.

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Aug 2001 08:40:07 -0400

gramps (0.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * This version of the gramps package for debian includes the upstream authors
    changes for fixing bug #101466
  * Fixed some minor typos in the changelog as well.

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Jul 2001 19:59:23 -0500

gramps (0.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * A minor cosmetic touch up where a word was misspelled on the main GUI and
    in the menu list.
    Closes: #101466
  * Added a README file to the examples directory explaining how to use/open
    the example files without getting errors. This will probably be removed
    in a near upcoming release as the author may have fixed the problem.
    Closes: #101463
  * The last package of gramps was built with a broken dpkg-dev which caused
    an automated bug report. I installed a better version of dpkg-dev in order
    to rebuild this package.
    Closes: #102531
  * The author has finally addressed the issue of a missing help file. Though
    as of now none have been created the error produced before is gone and the
    author is working on better documentation.
    Closes: #99617

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jun 2001 20:27:30 -0500

gramps (0.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Full identification in the program as well as the docs now shows that this
    is version 0.3.1. A Bug was filed on 0.3.0 because the author did not
    include and information stating the program had actually changed.
    Closes: #101462
  * There is an outstanding bug against gramps at the moment #101463 which
    is caused by gramps creating (attempting) a temporary file in a non-
    writable directory '/usr/share/doc/gramps/examples'. This can easily
    be avoided by copying the example files to your home directory or to a
    writable temporary directory. This, however is just a workaround an in
    no way is a means to closing this bug.

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Jun 2001 11:19:21 -0500

gramps (0.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * This package closes the wishlist bug where I was a bit lazy on creating
    a package for the new upstream release.
    Closes: #101254

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Mon, 18 Jun 2001 08:08:53 -0500

gramps (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * The upstream author now includes sample gedcom and sample gramps files
    with the source. These are placed in the usual example directory.
    This closes a wishlist bug in the bugs database but it seems that the
    server that holds bugs.debian.org and lists.debian.org is down. I'll
    re-upload a new package to close those bugs as soon as the server gets
    back up. But I am uploading the package ASAP as it fixes several program
    bugs that can be considered critical.

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Jun 2001 22:11:27 -0500

gramps (0.1.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Important note here. If you fail to follow thru with the wizard you are
    prompted with when gramps first runs you will receive the same error as
    stated in bug 98745 about invalid cast from `(unknown)' to `GtkObject'.
    This is not a bug with the package or the program but rather with the way
    the program is written. It is assuming that a widget is there that is not
    due to canceling out the wizard.
    Closes: #98745
  * This package now suggests python-reportlab and python-imaging in order to
    produce reports in PDF format. I should have included these earlier but
    failed to notice the naming convention used for the reportlab package.

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Wed, 30 May 2001 16:56:45 -0500

gramps (0.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * My last bug was reopened due to my lack of common sense. This release
    should fix the small problem.
    Closes: #98646
  * Edited the manual page and control files because this release of gramps
    no longer supports LaTeX in favor of PDF.
  * Changed Section in the control file to be "misc" instead of "x11"

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Sat, 26 May 2001 18:27:09 -0500

gramps (0.1.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * It seems as though there is a classes structure change between versions
    0.5.x and 0.6.x of PyXML and gramps has only been tested with the
    0.6.x branch. Changed dependency of python-xml to call for >=0.6.0-1
    This should take care of the startup problem some people have had.
    Bug Fixed. Closes: #98646

  * Silly me named the menu file wrong so it never got included into the
    Debian Menu system. Gramps should now show up under Apps->Tools. Have
    no idea how I overlooked this.

  * Wrote a more in depth manpage for Gramps. This manpage will more than
    likely be included in the main source distribution of gramps.

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Thu, 24 May 2001 22:08:26 -0500

gramps (0.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Failed to add python-glade as a dependency. Fixed. Closes: #98406

 -- Brandon L. Griffith <brandon@debian.org>  Tue, 22 May 2001 16:49:26 -0400

gramps (0.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
