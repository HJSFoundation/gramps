sudo: required

python:
 - 3.3 # This is irrelevant, because the virtualenv is not used at all

# FIXME: The minimum requirement for Gramps is Python 3.2, so a test environment
# for Python 3.2 should be added to this environment which is Python 3.3. It
# will not be possible to run coverage under Python 3.2, because coverage is
# Python 3.3 (or above) only.

before_install:

install:
# The working directory is set to /home/travis/build/gramps-project/gramps
# by the automatic git checkout.

# Download Sean Ross-Ross's Pure Python module containing a framework to
# manipulate and analyze python astï¿½s and bytecode. This is loaded to
# /home/travis/build/gramps-project/gramps/meta
# FIXME: This should be loaded from the release directory at
# https://pypi.python.org/pypi/meta
 - git clone -b master https://github.com/srossross/meta

# Build Gramps package. This seems to copy everything to
# /home/travis/build/scripts-3.3
 - python setup.py build

before_script:
# Create the Gramps database directory.
 - mkdir -p ~/.gramps/grampsdb/
# set PYTHONPATH so the directly installed module (meta) is picked up from
# /home/travis/build/gramps-project/gramps/meta
 - export PYTHONPATH=meta
# set module exclusions. --exclude=TestUser because of older version of mock
# without configure_mock
 - export EXCLUDE="--exclude=TestcaseGenerator"
#   --exclude=merge_ref_test"
# set GRAMPS_RESOURCES for locale, data,image and documentation
 - export GRAMPS_RESOURCES=.
# Install addons
 - mkdir -p ~/.gramps/gramps51/plugins/

script:
# Ignore the virtualenv entirely. Use nosetests3, python3 (3.4.0) and coverage

after_success:
# apt-get installs python3-coverage, but codecov only invokes coverage, so make
# a link
 - sudo ln /usr/bin/python3-coverage /usr/bin/coverage

# We have to use the bash script because the apt-get coverage does not install
# codecov. If we used pip to install codecov, it would run inside the
# virtualenv, and that doesn't work. Change the path to ensure that codecov
# picks up coverage from /usr/bin, rather than from
# /home/travis/virtualenv/python3.3.6/bin/
