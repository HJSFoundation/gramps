.B \fBDESCRIPTION\fP
Gramps is a Free/OpenSource genealogy program. It is written in Python,
using  the GTK+/GNOME interface.  Gramps should seem familiar to anyone
who has used other genealogy programs before such as Family Tree  Maker
(TM),   Personal Ancestral Files (TM), or the GNU Geneweb.  It supports
importing of the ever popular GEDCOM format which is used world wide by
almost all other genealogy software.
.TP
.B \fBOPTIONS\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBgramps\fP \fIFILE\fP
When \fIFILE\fP is given (without any flags) as a family tree name or
as a family tree database directory, then it is opened and an
interactive  session is started. If \fIFILE\fP is a file format under‐
stood by Gramps, an empty family tree is created  whose name is
based  on  the \fIFILE\fP name and the data is imported into it. The
rest of the options is ignored. This way of launching is suit‐
able for using gramps as a handler for genealogical data in e.g.
web browsers. This invocation can accept any data format  native
to gramps, see below.
.TP
.B \fB\-f\fP , \fB\-\-format=\fP \fIFORMAT\fP
Explicitly specify format of \fIFILE\fP given by preceding \fB\-i\fP ,
or \fB\-e\fP option. If the \fB\-f\fP option is not given for any
\fIFILE\fP , the format of that file is guessed according to its extension
or MIME\-type.
.sp
Formats  available for export are \fBgramps\-xml\fP (guessed if \fIFILE\fP
ends with \fB\&.gramps\fP ), \fBgedcom\fP (guessed if \fIFILE\fP ends with
\fB\&.ged\fP ), or any file export available through the Gramps plugin
system.
.sp
Formats available for import are \fBgramps\-xml\fP , \fBgedcom\fP ,
\fBgramps\-pkg\fP (guessed if \fIFILE\fP ends with \fB\&.gpkg\fP ),
and \fBgeneweb\fP (guessed if \fIFILE\fP ends with \fB\&.gw\fP ).
.sp
Formats available for export are \fBgramps\-xml\fP , \fBgedcom\fP ,
\fBgramps\-pkg\fP , \fBwft\fP (guessed if \fIFILE\fP ends with \fB\&.wft\fP ),
\fBgeneweb\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-l\fP
Print a list of known family trees.
.TP
.B \fB\-L\fP
Print a detailed list of known family trees.
.TP
.B \fB\-u\fP , \fB\-\-force\-unlock\fP
Unlock a locked database.
.TP
.B \fB\-O\fP , \fB\-\-open=\fP \fIDATABASE\fP
Open \fIDATABASE\fP which  must be an existing database directory or
existing family tree name. If no action, import or export
options are given on the command line then an interactive ses‐
sion is started using that database.
.TP
.B \fB\-i\fP , \fB\-\-import=\fP \fIFILE\fP
Import data from \fIFILE\fP . If you haven\(aqt specified a database, then
an empty database is created for you called Family Tree x
(where x is an incrementing number).
.sp
When more than one input file is given, each has to be preceded
by \fB\-i\fP flag. The files are imported in the specified order, i.e.
\fB\-i\fP \fIFILE1\fP \fB\-i\fP \fIFILE2\fP and \fB\-i\fP \fIFILE2\fP \fB\-i\fP \fIFILE1\fP
might produce different gramps IDs in the resulting database.
.TP
.B \fB\-e\fP , \fB\-\-export=\fP \fIFILE\fP
Export data into \fIFILE\fP . For \fBgramps\-xml\fP , \fBgedcom\fP
, \fBwft\fP , \fBgramps\-pkg\fP , and \fBgeneweb\fP , the \fIFILE\fP is the
name of the resulting file.
.sp
When more than one output file is given, each has to be preceded
by \fB\-e\fP flag. The files are written one by one, in the specified order.
.TP
.B \fB\-a\fP , \fB\-\-action=\fP \fIACTION\fP
Perform \fIACTION\fP on the imported data. This is done after all
imports are successfully completed. Currently available  actions
are \fBsummary\fP (same  as  Reports\->View\->Summary), \fBcheck\fP (same as
Tools\->Database Processing\->Check and Repair), \fBreport\fP (generates
report),  and  tool  (runs a plugin tool).  Both \fBreport\fP and \fBtool\fP
need the \fIOPTIONSTRING\fP supplied by the \fB\-p\fP flag).
.sp
The \fIOPTIONSTRING\fP should satisfy the following conditions:
It must not contain any  spaces. If some arguments need to
include spaces, the string should be enclosed with quotation
marks, i.e., follow the shell syntax. Option string is a list
of  pairs  with name and value (separated by the equality sign).
The name and value pairs must be separated by commas.
.sp
Most of the report or tools options are specific for each report
or tool. However, there are some common options.
.sp
\fBname=name\fP
This mandatory option determines which report or tool will be
run. If the supplied name does not correspond to any  available
report or tool, an error message will be printed followed by the
list of available reports or tools (depending on the \fIACTION\fP ).
.sp
\fBshow=all\fP
This will produce the list of names for all options available
for a given report or tool.
.sp
\fBshow=optionname\fP
This will print the description of the functionality supplied by
\fIoptionname\fP, as well as what are the acceptable types and  values
for this option.
.sp
Use the above options to find out everything about a given
report.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When more than one output action is given, each has to be preceded  by
\fB\-a\fP flag. The actions are performed one by one, in the specified order.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\-d\fP , \fB\-\-debug=\fP \fILOGGER_NAME\fP
Enables debug logs for development and testing. Look at the
source code for details
.TP
.B \fB\-\-version\fP
Prints the version number of gramps and then exits
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBOperation\fP
If the first argument on the command line does not start with dash
(i.e. no flag), gramps will attempt to open the file with the name
given by the first argument and start interactive session, ignoring the
rest of the command line arguments.
.sp
If the  \fB\-O\fP flag is given, then gramps will try opening the supplied
database and then work with that data, as instructed by the further
command line parameters.
.sp
With or without the \fB\-O\fP flag, there could be multiple imports, exports,
and actions specified further on the command line by using \fB\-i\fP ,
\fB\-e\fP , and \fB\-a\fP flags.
.sp
The order of \fB\-i\fP , \fB\-e\fP , or \fB\-a\fP options does not matter. The actual order
always is: all imports (if any) \-> all actions (if any) \-> all  exports
(if any). But opening must always be first!
.sp
If no \fB\-O\fP or \fB\-i\fP option is given, gramps will launch its main window and
start the usual interactive session with the empty database, since
there is no data to process, anyway.
.sp
If no \fB\-e\fP  or \fB\-a\fP options are given, gramps will launch its main window
and start the usual interactive session with the database resulted from
all imports. This database resides in the \fBimport_db.grdb\fP under
\fB~/.gramps/import\fP directory.
.sp
The error encountered during import, export, or action, will be  either
dumped to stdout (if  these  are exceptions handled by gramps) or to
\fIstderr\fP (if these are not handled). Use usual shell redirections of
\fIstdout\fP and \fIstderr\fP to save messages and errors in files.
.TP
.B \fBEXAMPLES\fP
To open an existing family tree and import an xml file into it, one
may type:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBgramps \-O\fP \fI\(aqMy Family Tree\(aq\fP \fB\-i\fP \fI~/db3.gramps\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above changes the opened family tree, to do the  same, but import
both in a temporary family tree and start an interactive session, one
may type:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBgramps \-i\fP \fI\(aqMy Family Tree\(aq\fP \fB\-i\fP \fI~/db3.gramps\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To import four databases (whose formats can be  determined from their
names) and then check the resulting database for errors, one may type:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBgramps \-i\fP \fIfile1.ged\fP \fB\-i\fP \fIfile2.tgz\fP \fB\-i\fP \fI~/db3.gramps\fP
\fB\-i\fP \fIfile4.wft\fP \fB\-a\fP \fIcheck\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To explicitly specify the formats in the above  example,  append  file‐
names with appropriate \fB\-f\fP options:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBgramps \-i\fP \fIfile1.ged\fP \fB\-f\fP \fIgedcom\fP \fB\-i\fP \fIfile2.tgz\fP \fB\-f\fP
\fIgramps\-pkg\fP \fB\-i\fP \fI~/db3.gramps\fP \fB\-f\fP \fIgramps\-xml\fP \fB\-i\fP \fIfile4.wft\fP
\fB\-f\fP \fIwft\fP \fB\-a\fP \fIcheck\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To record the database resulting from all imports, supply \fB\-e\fP flag  (use
\fB\-f\fP if the filename does not allow gramps to guess the format):
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBgramps \-i\fP \fIfile1.ged\fP \fB\-i\fP \fIfile2.tgz\fP \fB\-e\fP \fI~/new\-package\fP
\fB\-f\fP \fIgramps\-pkg\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To import three databases and start interactive gramps session with the
result:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBgramps \-i\fP \fIfile1.ged\fP \fB\-i\fP \fIfile2.tgz\fP \fB\-i\fP \fI~/db3.gramps\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To run the Verify tool from the commandline and output the result to
stdout:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBgramps \-O\fP \fI\(aqMy Family Tree\(aq\fP \fB\-a\fP \fItool\fP \fB\-p name=\fP \fIverify\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, to start normal interactive session type:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBgramps\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\fP
The program checks whether these environment variables are set:
.sp
\fBLANG\fP  \-  describe, which language to use: Ex.: for polish language this
variable has to be set to pl_PL.UTF\-8.
.sp
\fBGRAMPSHOME\fP \- if set, force Gramps to use  the  specified  directory  to
keep program settings and databases there. By default, this variable is
not set and gramps assumes that the folder with all databases and  pro‐
file  settings  should  be  created  within  the  user  profile  folder
(described by environment variable HOME for Linux  or  USERPROFILE  for
Windows 2000/XP).
.TP
.B \fBCONCEPTS\fP
Supports a python\-based plugin system, allowing import and export writ‐
ers, report generators, tools, and display filters to be added  without
modification of the main program.
.sp
In addition to generating direct printer output, report generators also
target other systems, such as \fILibreOffice.org\fP , \fIAbiWord\fP , \fIHTML\fP,
or \fILaTeX\fP to allow the users to modify the format to suit their needs.
