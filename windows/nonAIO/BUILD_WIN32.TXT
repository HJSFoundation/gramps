
HOW TO CREATE A WINDOWS INSTALLER

Introduction.
=============
It is possible to build two types of installer
 
    - Release installer, intended for end user. The release installer is built from the 
      release tarball.

    - Development installer, used for testing nsis install script, and packaging issues.
      This installer is not intended for end user. Instalation of a Development installer
      will overwrite an already installed released Gramps application. Running a development
      installer will warn with dialog that the installer is not an official release.

The following procedure is capable of creating a Windows installer from either Windows 
or Linux OS's as long as the correct tools are installed.

The following programs are required to be installed and on the path
    - python (currently only tested on python 2.6 - not ready for python 3.x yet)
    - nsis  at least V2.42  (http://nsis.sourceforge.net  or  apt-get install nsis)
    - msgfmt                (for windows http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gettext.htm)
    
    Extra tools for development installer build
    - svn                   (subversion )
    
Release Installer
=================
To create an offical release of gramps download the required tarball for a release 
from sourceforge. The files that are contained within the tarball consist of the files
that make up an offical release.

i.e.

    WINDOWS
        [PATH_TO_SCRIPT]\build_GrampsWin32.py -t TARBALL_PATH
            or 
        c:\python26\python [PATH_TO_SCRIPT]\build_GrampsWin32.py  -t TARBALL_PATH
        
    LINUX
        python2.6 [PATH_TO_SCRIPT]/build_GrampsWin32.py -t TARBALL_PATH

where TARBALL path is the path to the tarball including the tarball name.
The build will happen on the dir you run the script from, you can also 
control the build dir with the -oDIR,  --out=DIR  options 


Development installer - Build from within SVN version tree.
===========================================================
NOTE: This installer will package ALL plugins that are part of SVN version
      control into the installer, even if it's not intended for end user.

      ** The offical RELEASE of GRAMPS is built from tarball. (see above)**
      
It works with a subversion working copy of Gramps, it automatically 
queries configure.in to get the correct gramps version number that 
includes the SVN revision number.

Procedure:
From the command prompt, change to the path 
[GRAMPS_SVN]\windows\builder

Run the build script with no arguments, the script will assume it's being run
from a gramps subversion working copy, and then commence the build.

It will export the sources from svn to create the correct directory image,
complile the langauage files, and package all up into the installer.

i.e.
    WINDOWS
        build_GrampsWin32.py 
            or 
        c:\python26\python build_GrampsWin32.py 
        
    LINUX
        python2.6 build_GrampsWin32.py
        
============== Build Script Options ================================================
>build_GrampsWin32.py --help

Create Gramps Windows Installer.
Usage:
    python build_GrampsWin32.py [options] [repository_path]

Arguments:
    repository_path                   Path to the repository to build GRAMPS from, this can be either
                                        - The root path of a SVN working copy
                                        - A tarball that has been saved on local disk
                                        - Left blank to build the SVN working copy this file is part of
Options:
    -h,     --help                This help message.
    -oDIR,  --out=DIR             Directory to build files (optional)
            --nsis_only           Build NSIS only (does not Clean & Build All)
    -t      --tarball             Build release version from Tarball.
    -mDIR, --msgdir=DIR           Directory to msgfmt.exe
